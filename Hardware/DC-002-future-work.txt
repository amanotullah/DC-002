DC-002 Future Work

1) It should be possible to remove crystal and oscillator load capacitors and instead drive clock on the ATMega32U4 directly from the 32Khz square wave output from the DS3231 chip.

2) The back panel thickness should be slightly reduced around the rotary encoder so the nut fits more completely on the threaded shaft

3) more support between back panel and back of PCB, so when removing USB cable, the pcb does not deflect
